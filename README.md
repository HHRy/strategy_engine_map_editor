# strategy_engine_map_builder

A VueJS / Electron application for editing and creating files
in the `.rtsmap` format for my [RTS Game Engine][1].

This is basically a toy / fun side porject much like the RTS
game engine itself. Once it's "ready", I'll make a release and
publish binaries.

In the meantime, if you've stumbled accross this, please have
fun and feel free to jump in!
